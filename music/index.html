                      depressing mishap consequences
                      make for a story to tell

                      And all these things we do
                      don’t matter at all to you
                      condition your demise
                      and do what you’ve always liked
                      you’ll die before you know
                      if you sit around the cozy fire
                      warming up your toes

                      The media from yesteryear
                      Wont stick in your brain
                      You cant appreciate the art
                      That brought the crafter pain
                      It grows old too fast
                      The impact doesn’t last
                      recycled like a can of soda
                      stranded in the middle of the road

                      And all these things we do
                      don’t matter at all to you
                      condition your demise
                      and do what you’ve always liked
                      you’ll die before you know
                      regretting what you couldn’t sow
                      so do what you want
                      cuz that’ll make you happier
                      until your candles fade and flicker out

                        And we're still high
                        Addicted to
                        The touch of you

                        Comfortable there
                        Rocking in your chair
                        guess that'll change soon

                        Me and you
                        Are in the blue
                        Chase each other
                        Like puppy dogs do

                        Circling their tails
                        Going nowhere
                        Watch one hundred
                        Soldiers fall

                        Slain swung sword
                        Dull as a board
                        Chewed up by the river bed's jaw

                        I'll be here
                        I'll meet you there
                        The plan is set but I'm made to fall.
                        But I'll stumble all along.

                      While you talk away
                      Trust me man I haven't much to say

                      Sitting in a pit with a hatful of hollow
                      My mind's another place where I tend to wallow
                      Just another thief when the sun goes down
                      Oh, why's it so hard to fucking leave this town
                      I jumped ship twice, but it wasn't worth it
                      I tried to get away somehow I ended at the pulpit
                      Now I'm here again at the same ol' place
                      Listing my excuses so you'll never see my face again

                      Look at me looking at cynical ol' you
                      I could careless if you think I'm rude
                      Nothing accepted no one's accepting
                      That's fine because I think when I'm not thinking
                      I jumped ship again this time it was worth it
                      The phantom of the hourglass just made him oh so broken
                      And here's another story of a reckless young man
